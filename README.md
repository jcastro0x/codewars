My solutions to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)' katas. <br>
Each directory it's a kata. In their directories are a __README__ with the instructions of the kata, and the URL to it.

# Unit test frameworks
I use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for C++ katas and [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) for C katas. 
Remember to use ```--recurse-submodules``` when you clone:

    git clone https://github.com/jcastro0x/codewars.git --recurse-submodules
