This repository includes my answers to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) katas.

Each folder corresponds to a specific kata. Inside these folders, a __README__ file can be found which contains the 
instructions for the kata, along with the associated URL.

# Testing Frameworks
For C++ katas, I utilize [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), and for C katas, I employ [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion).

Ensure to use the ```--recurse-submodules``` parameter during the cloning process:

    git clone https://github.com/jcastro0x/codewars.git --recurse-submodules
